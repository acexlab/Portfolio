Project: Personal Portfolio Website (explained for a 5-year-old)

1) What is this?
- This is a website that shows who Jonadh is and the cool things he can make.
- A website is like a digital poster you can open in a web browser (Chrome, Edge).

2) Imagine the website like a picture book with pages:
- Home: The first page that says "Hi" and shows what Jonadh is building.
- About: A page that tells who Jonadh is, where he lives, and what he likes.
- Works: A page that shows the projects Jonadh has made (like a school project gallery).
- Skills: A page that shows what Jonadh knows how to do (like a report card with progress bars).
- Contact: A page to send Jonadh a message or copy his email so you can talk to him.

3) How the website is made (simple steps):
- We use a tool called React. Think of React as a set of LEGO instructions.
- Each page is a LEGO block (a small file) that has pieces like headings, text, and buttons.
- The computer follows these instructions to put the page together and show it on the screen.

4) Words that are used and what they mean:
- Component: A small part of the page (like a LEGO brick). Each page is a component.
- JSX: Special code that looks like HTML. It's how we draw the page using React.
- Props: Small notes we pass to components. Example: the project title and picture are props.
- State: A memory inside a component. Example: the Contact page remembers if the email was copied.

5) Extra magical things:
- Shader Background: Animated colors behind the page that make it look cool (like moving lights).
- Routing: When you click a link (like "Works"), the site shows a new page without reloading — it's like turning a page in a book.
- Form: The message box is a tiny letter you can send. The website can send that letter to an email service.

6) How to try it on your computer (adult steps):
- Install Node.js and Git.
- Open a terminal (PowerShell) and run:
  npm install
  npm run dev
- Open the browser at the address shown (usually http://localhost:5173).

7) If something breaks (easy troubleshooting):
- If the page is white, check the terminal for errors — it usually tells you what file has a problem.
- If an image is missing, the terminal or browser console will show a 404 (file not found).

8) How to change the words on the page (easy edit):
- Find files in `src/pages/` and open a file like `Home.jsx`.
- Change the text between <h1>...</h1> or <p>...</p>, save, and the site updates.

9) Who can learn from this?
- Kids: can learn that websites are like books made of blocks (components).
- Beginners: can learn where to change text and how to add a new page.
- Teachers: can use this as a simple demo of modern web apps.

10) Why it matters:
- Making a portfolio website helps show your projects to other people (employers, classmates).
- You can keep improving it by adding new projects, colors, and animations.
